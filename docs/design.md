# Paperwurks React Application - Design Document

## Project Overview

Paperwurks is a comprehensive property due diligence platform that facilitates secure document management and communication between property owners, estate agents, solicitors, and prospective buyers. The React application implements a multi-role system with distinct workflows for each user type.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API + useReducer for global state, React Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Styling**: Custom CSS system (no external UI library dependency)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Design Principles

- **Component-First Architecture**: Reusable, composable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## User Roles & Permissions

### Primary User Types

1. **Property Owners** - Create and manage property packs
2. **Estate Agents** - Coordinate between owners, buyers, and solicitors
3. **Solicitors** - Review documents and provide legal assessments
4. **Prospective Buyers** - View shared property information (limited access)

### Permission Matrix

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Strategy

- **Global State**: User authentication, app settings, notifications
- **Feature State**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex forms
- **URL State**: React Router for navigation state

### Component Architecture

```
Components/
├── Common/           # Reusable UI components
├── Forms/           # Form-specific components
├── Layout/          # Layout and navigation
├── Features/        # Feature-specific components
└── Pages/           # Page-level components
```

### Data Flow Patterns

- **Server State**: React Query for caching, synchronization, and loading states
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with controlled/uncontrolled patterns
- **Event Handling**: Custom hooks for complex interactions
